i can realate to the fact that i have had many dreams that i did or could not persue but I believe that those dreams had created who i am today. For example my dream was to live my life in the military, unfortunately that did not work out. I had been injured and forced into an honorable discharge. But those experiences made me who i am today. I also had felt a hard hit to my emotions when he mentions, "Its not about how you achieve your dreams, but how you live your life" my grandpa before he passed away had told me that and i had not heard that since he passed.
